# 3.0.0

The addon now has a status indicator, so you can see if the Chrome Mask is on or off without even clicking on it. Thanks for the contribution, @dannycolin!

# 2.0.0

Chrome Mask now automatically updates the Chrome version, without needing an addon update. It does that by requesting the current stable Chrome major version [from an API](https://chrome-mask-remote-storage.0b101010.services/current-chrome-major-version.txt). The update runs once a day, in the background, without bothering you.

# 1.0.0

This was the initial release!
